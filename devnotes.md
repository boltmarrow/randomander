- rate limit to ~10 requests per second
### TODO
- make it pretty
    - put some CSS on that bad buoy
- more filters
    - top or bottom X% of edhrec popularity
    - stuff scryfall search doesn't offer
- changing the filter as a query runs could have some strange effects but nothing site-breaking i think....
- let user cancel search (sometimes you notice a typo during a long search or something)
- would be faster to send all API requests after the first at once. oh well!
- get/reroll dichotomy not great bc more than just the last search is cached
- whole site could stand to be state-ified for cleanliness
- could also just keep all legal commanders in the site data and filter them locally
    - faster but way more complicated, we'd have to decode scryfall syntax
